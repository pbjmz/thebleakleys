            <h2>James Bleakley II</h2>
            <p>I am an Education Sciences major at UF specializing in Education Technology. I plan to advance into a career focused around education technology and curriculum design. I have worked in education for 5 years and have been both a substitute teacher and a paraprofessional.</p>
            <p>Throughout my time in the education space I have worked with all grades (PreK–12) and find that this experience is invaluable to me and my future within the space. While I have not always wanted to be an educator, I have always enjoyed being educated. This ties into my personal philosophy of education: that in order to educate you must consistently educate yourself.</p>
            <p>When I am not educating myself or others, I enjoy reading (fantasy and sci-fi), traveling, and discovering new music. A non-career related goal of mine is to visit all 50 states. Though I've only seen 11 so far, I hope to add a few more as soon as possible.</p>
